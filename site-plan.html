      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Header
        <br>This area will clearly guide you to the different areas/pages of the rest of the content. Having an accomplishments 
        <br>button and maybe an explore tab and a contact me that has a dropdown with different options like my phone number, 
        <br>email, social media, etc.
        <br>
        <br>The main screen will be the main showcase of my accomplishments and/or work history. Here I will be able to display 
        <br>the different school and personal projects that employers will be able to look at and go through so they can see what 
        <br>I am capable of. I like the idea of having a "coming soon" area to show that I am currently working on more and have
        <br>plans to update the site with additional content. Languages I know. I will also add a way to view my Google calender 
        <br>for availability here.
        <br>
        <br>The Main page Stuff (from top to bottom)
        <br>•	logo and nav bar on top with a dropdown menu for contact
        <br>•	Header with my name and major/career/specialty 
        <br>•	the main page will have the languages I know, my skills, my best work, and a downloadable resume option
        <br>•	I might put the resume in the footer so that way it is available on every page

      <h3>Accomplishments/Goals</h3>
      <p>
        Accomplishments
        I want to either have an entire page dedicated to this or just have a sub-page inside of one of the mains 
        that shows off both academic and nonacademic accomplishments and also have an area that displays the things 
        I would like to accomplish or something that I am currently working on

        Goals
        I think the best area for goals would be to have a hover effect that shows the things that I am working 
        towards, Academic and non-academic.

      <h3>Meet Me/Bio</h3>
      <p>
        Here I will put random things about myself—the music I like, Where I grew up, stuff about my family, etc. 
        Basically, this would be like the cover letter of a basic resume but also have a little bit of this info 
        sprinkled around the entire site.
